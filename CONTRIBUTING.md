# Contribute to stardust

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to waterdrop. If you find something incorrect or missing, please leave comments, suggestions or file bug.

## Reporting issues

Reporting issues are a great way to contribute to the project. We are perpetually grateful about a well-written, thorough bug report.

Before raising a new issue, check our [issue list](https://github.com/UnderTreeTech/stardust/issues) to determine if it already contains the problem that you are facing.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you for more information. Please be as detailed as possible. The following questions might serve as a template for writing a detailed report:

- What were you trying to achieve?
- What are the expected results?
- What are the received results?
- What are the steps to reproduce the issue?
- In what environment did you encounter the issue?

Feature requests can also be submitted as issues.


## Pull requests

Good pull requests (e.g. patches, improvements, new features) are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid unrelated commits.

Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing new features, refactoring code etc.), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the maintainers might not want to merge into the project.

First add an issue to the project to discuss the improvement. Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project. If in doubt, consult the [Effective Go style guide](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and [Uber Go style guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide).
